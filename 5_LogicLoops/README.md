# Chapter 5: Program Logic and Indefinite Loops

## Outline of Material

Sections:
* 5.1 The while loop
* 5.2 Fencepost algorithm
* 5.3 The boolean type
* 5.4 User errors
* 5.5 Assertions and Program Logic
* 5.6 Case study: NumberGuess 

Assessments:

While loops: do while loops:
* How they work, syntax
* Avoiding infinite loops, spotting infinite loops
* Situations requiring indefinite vs definite loops

Fencepost algorithms:
* Splitting up interval
* Sentinel algorithm/pattern

Boolean types:
* Truth tables
* DeMorgan's Law
* and/or, advanced conditionals
* Negation

User error:
* Exception throwing
* Abstraction

Assertions:
* Formal verification
* Deeper debugging
* Knowing what's true when, seeing/thinking about complexity of program

## Profiles

## Lecture Code 

Taylor cos?
* while loop, fencepost algorithm, sentinel algorithm

isPrime
* More complex program with more complex logic/assertions
* Sieve of Arasthnosenes
* Use debugger during lecture, explore logic more deeply

## Worksheet Code

Euler gcd algorithm
* implementing it
