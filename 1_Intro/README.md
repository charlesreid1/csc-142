# Chapter 1: Introduction to Java

## Outline of Material

Sections:
* 1.1 - Basic computing concepts (algorithms, programs, hardware, software, JVM, JRE, JDK)
* 1.2 - And now, Java (classes, headers, methods, strings, printing)
* 1.3 - Program errors (syntax errors, compiler level; logic errors, code level)
* 1.4 - Procedural decomposition (functions vs. objects, static methods, flow control)
* 1.5 - Case study: DrawFigs (turning a task into a pattern, generalization, common components)

Assessments:
* Know definitions of terms
* Writing and running Hello World, and how it works
* Functions, objects, and program flow
* Errors: syntax and logical errors

## Profiles

## Lecture Code

### DrawFigs

The in-class example for Chapter 1 will focus on the 
DrawFigs program provided in the textbook. This shows
how to use println() to print things to the console.

### Vertical

This is a simple program to perform a calculation and
print the result. Shows the students how to apply 
mathematical concepts and implement formulas.

## Worksheet Code

### Physical Properties

Assignment: You will look up, write down, and print out
the density of ten different chemical compounds. 

Specifications: You must select at least one unique chemical
compound - a chemical compound so unique, you are absolutely certain
no one elese in the class will select it. (Be creative!)
