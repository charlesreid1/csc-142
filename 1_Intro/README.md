## Outline of Material

Sections:
* 1.1 - Basic computing concepts (algorithms, programs, hardware, software, JVM, JRE, JDK)
* 1.2 - And now, Java (classes, headers, methods, strings, printing)
* 1.3 - Program errors (syntax errors, compiler level; logic errors, code level)
* 1.4 - Procedural decomposition (functions vs. objects, static methods, flow control)
* 1.5 - Case study: DrawFigs (turning a task into a pattern, generalization, common components)

Assessments:
* Know definitions of terms
* Writing and running Hello World, and how it works
* Functions, objects, and program flow
* Errors: syntax and logical errors

## Profiles

Profiles for Chapter 1:
* James Gosling
* Grace Hopper

## Lecture Code

DrawFigs:
* Focus on DrawFigs example program provided by textbook
* Prints things to the console with println()

Vertical:
* Performs a calculation
* Prints out the result
* Keeps them on their (mathematical) toes

## Worksheet Code

Physical Properties:
* Assignment: You will look up, write down, and print out the density of ten different chemical compounds.  
* Specifications: You must select at least one unique chemical compound.
* The unique compound must be a chemical compound so unique, you are absolutely certain no one elese in the class will select it. (Be creative!)
