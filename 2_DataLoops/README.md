# Teaching Material


## Lecture Example: Vertical

Vertical is a program that shows how to implement a simple formula to perform
a calculation and print the results. This explores how to use the double
primitive types, order of operations, and formulas.


## In-Class Worksheet: Caesar Cipher

In Chapter 2 we will utilize what we've learned about 
data types and for loops to implement a Caesar Cipher,
which is a simple replacement cipher that shifts 
each letter by a fixed amount.

For example, suppose we implement a Caesar cipher 
with a shift of 2. Then if A = 1, B = 2, etc., then 
these are shifted by 2, so A becomes 1 + 2 = 3 = C,
B becomes 2 + 2 = 4 = D, C becomes E, etc.

In this way, the message HELLO becomes:

    HELLO -> JGNNQ

We will implement this shift to encode strings using 
a Caesar Cipher.
