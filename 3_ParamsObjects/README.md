# Chapter 3: Parameters and Objects 

This directory contains materials related to Chapter 3 of Reges and Stepp, 
which covers parameters, methods, return values, and some basic object 
terminology.

## Outline of Material

Sections:
* 3.1 - Parameters
* 3.2 - Methods returning values
* 3.3 - Using objects
* 3.4 - Case study Projectile trajectory

Assessments:
* Parameter notation, purpose, and how they work
* Return value notation, purpose, and how they work
* Object concepts and definitions
* Applying object concepts to Strings
* Projectile trajectory: focus on a more complex application/program

## Profiles

Profiles for Chapter 3:
* Carl Gauss

## Lecture Code

Sum of integers
* Sum of first N integers - implement a formula that returns a value
* Ties in with Carl Gauss
* Algorithms, pattern-finding, etc.

Pythagorean theorem
* Finding hypotenuse given legs - implement a formula that returns a value
* Recap what we've been able to solve
* Profound connection between programming and math

## Worksheet Code

Caesar Cipher encrypting:
* Char shift is the key, getting them to think about the modular operation
* Hint: try printing all the characters (for char c='a', etc.)
* Try executing this Java code: 'a'+5
